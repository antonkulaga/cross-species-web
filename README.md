Sketch for cross-species website
---------------------------------

I did not have much time to work on it, it is *super-ugly*, but I included 3 key elements:
* sample selection datagrid
* gene selection selector
* heatmap that will display expression values

Some details are not mentioned in HTML:
* we should have a button or other mechanism to select samples by tissue or species as putting checkboxes there take too much time
* for genes there should be two ways of selecting: by gene list (provided or the one you can upload) and also by manual selection
* in the heatmap example instead of GO categories there will be gene ids and names
