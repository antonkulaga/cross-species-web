Cetacean liver samples were typically bigger frozen blocks, and for these RNA extraction was conducted on tissue pieces cut from the central section of the frozen piece, to maximise RNA quality. Total RNA was extracted from snap-frozen liver tissue with RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). 20 mg of tissue were weighed on dry-ice and immediately homogenized in 600 microliters of RLT buffer containing 10 microliters of beta-mercaptoethanol per mililiter of buffer.

Adaptor-ligated DNA was treated with sodium-bisulfite using the Imprint DNA Modification Kit from Sigma-Aldrich according to the manufacturer???s instructions for the one-step protocol. Bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified using PfuTurbo Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase from Agilent Technologies with 14???18 cycles depending on input amount. Size selection was performed by gel extraction for DNA fragments between 200 bp and 250 bp, as adapted from (Seisenberger et al., 2012).

Bisulfite-treated DNA was amplified using PfuTurbo Cx Hotstart DNA Polymerase from Agilent Technologies with 14???18 cycles depending on input amount. Size selection was performed by gel extraction for DNA fragments between 200 bp and 250 bp, as adapted from (Seisenberger et al., 2012).

Old sample libraries were sequenced using single-end protocol and a subsequent re-run using a paired-end protocol to increase coverage.",

The extracted RNA integrity was measured with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and a sample with an RNA Integrity Number greater than or equal to 8 was considered acceptable. ??? The libraries were generated using depleted RNA obtained from 1??g total RNA by TruSeq Sample Preparation RNA Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer???s without further modifications. The first step involves the removal of ribosomal RNA rRNA) using biotinylated, target-specific oligos combined with Ribo-Zero rRNA removal beads that depletes samples of both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial rRNA. Following purification, the RNA is fragmented into small pieces using divalent cations under elevated temperature. The cleaved RNA fragments are copied into first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase and random primers, followed by second strand cDNA synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H.
